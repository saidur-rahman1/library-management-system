# library-management-system
A GUI based management system for an educational institution that can keep a track of the books in its inventory along with the books borrowed and returned by its students. This system has two types of users, librarians and the system administrator. The librarians are responsible to keep a track of all books being received and issued by the library whereas the administrator is responsible to add, remove and keep track of the librarians who will be able to access the system. The front end GUI was developed using Java and Swing whereas the back end and database handling was done using MySQL.
